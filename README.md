## 🗂️ TaskManager – Java Practice Project

**Author:** Frank C. Vanris  
**Location:** Roosendaal, Netherlands  
**Purpose:** Personal Java development & architecture practice

### 📌 Overview
TaskManager is a personal project built in **Java** to help me practice core programming concepts, design patterns, and clean architecture principles. It’s a lightweight console-based application that allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks efficiently.

This project is not just about functionality—it's about refining my skills in **object-oriented programming**, **modular design**, and **code maintainability**. I built this tool for myself, but it’s structured in a way that others can easily understand, extend, or contribute to.

### 🎯 Features
